### **Changes**

Based off of the lecturers feedback from the last task I have made the following improvements to the application

1. Implemented a better navigation between pages by adding back buttons to allow the user to not have to close the app to open a different request.
2. Added a better reccomendation algoritm for the reccomendation feature in Task 2.
3. Ensured that i did my best to maintain my coding standards throught my work and keep more consistent in how I code my application.
